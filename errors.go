	// mode. Phase 1 preserves the legacy unique constraint on (namespace, key)
	// so pre-tenant consumers (v5.0.x) can continue to upsert safely during a
	// rolling deploy. Enable phase 2 via [WithTenantSchemaEnabled] once every
	// consumer is on v5.1+ — see MIGRATION_TENANT_SCOPED.md §4 for the full
	// upgrade runbook.
